# Comparison of models for predicting electricity price. 

Predicting the electricity price may look like an easy task, just as the forecasting of assets. But, in fact, there are a few ways of achieving this goal. The purpose of this project is to check and measure this differents paths to get the prediction of the electricity price. 

In this frontpage we are explaining the main structure of the project, how it is divided and how to go through it. If you are looking for a deeper study of the techniques and methods used, you can check the [document attached](https://github.com/JoelDela/TFM-Master_Data_Science_Kschool/blob/master/Comparison_of_ML_models.docx) in this repository where everything has been detailed.

### 0. Preparing the environment.

First of all, we have to create the appropiate environment. It would be a good idea to prepare it following the [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cwYA04H2VXTalkR78nYHDvJmm1QzhEZjSC_4WvjB1Vw/edit) that were given to us at the beginning of the master. > jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=1.0e10.
